- Often faced this situation where you had a movie in your mind to watch later and when you finally got time to watch you forgot the name of it??
- This application is the perfect solution for such situations
- This is a web application which pulls the data from [OMDB](https://www.omdbapi.com/) API to fetch the movies
- There are two screen
  - One is the search page where users can search movies/series and add them to their watchlist
  - Next one is the watchlist where users can view the list pf movies/series added to watchlist
- User will have the ability to remove an item from the watchlist
- The application uses local storage to store the info. So the list doesn't disapear after a refresh
